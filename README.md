# Gardyloo

## Project Overview

Gardyloo is an attempt to gameify the consumption of knowledge of other cultures. The intial first edition of the project has basic funtionality that allows for information at a glance.  The usage of materalize allows for a clean minimalstic interface that highlights the actionable information. The main focus will be on educating potential american travelers to cultural difference and laws that might seem unintuitive.  I feel that much of the travel information solicited to americans has a"BUZZFEED" aura surrounding the premesce of the site.  However, cultural fopaux are inexcusable; currently the project has minimal information other than what is standard.  Ultimatly I would like to implemt essays from experts on regions and countries that would help illuminate how to be respectful towards other cultures as guest, when we travel.
