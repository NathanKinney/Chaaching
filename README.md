##Project Overview

I personally believe that there is a lack of understanding of other cultures coming from an american perspective.  This app would make some key facts and customs, for a culture that an american might visit, easily and quickly accessible.  Ideally I'd like to dive into some darker and not as pleasant topics (ie drug culture and laws).  I'll start with the very basic and more pleasant points of information.

##Functionality

The basic premise would be to have a picture of a global map, hopefully map it out so on mouse hoover information regarding the country will display at a glance. I want to have essays written by native individuals to whichever country is clicked on.  That might take a bit of time to get going so i'll do a blank placeholder for the time being.  I plan on writing up a bit of something for Germany and I can get Iran in a timely manner from an old coworker.

##Data Model

I'd like to have a member log in so they can store countries to have alerts for.  Mainly the information for the DB will be articles if not even pseudo articles is fine.
## Set up
HomePage includes: 
* Login 
* World map 
* Maybe a about the page paragraph & region list on side

Region View:  Zoom in on the selected region, not much info

Country view: would like at least 9 components (displayed in a 3x3 grid thumb nails displayed on block when clicked it gives the detailed view) to include on the culture food and music.  Include the essay as the predominant piece of the page directly under that insert a picture gallery and list some info points
* Capital City

* Head political leader

* Language spoken declare if multiple are spoken

* Currency used

* Maybe visas potentially needed

* Traveling seasons and what to do ie Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.

* Traveling prices based on time of year super simple graph
                    
##Schedule
(6-26 to 7-27)
PHASE 1 (7-2 to 7-9)

- Get the database portion off the ground set relationships(just models and relate it to a basic basic template)

- Build the skeleton of the basic HTML set up

- Very minimal css strictly for readability 

- I want to do it this order to see where Ill need to study up on

- I'm going to have to do a fair bit of research on food music culture and politics so i'll try to start getting that done jetzt.

PHASE 2 (7-10 to 7-17)

- I think I want to start diving into the Vue portion here.  I'm thinking of trying to use that framework exclusively. Vue seems like a good inherent organization for what I'd like to do.

- Start working on mapping the world (Hover over country name of country will display above the map) maybe throw in a region view, might be too much.  If I do a region view it'll associate with a drop down menu that'll highlight the region.

* By the end of Phase 2 I want the the project to be functionally working.

PHASE 3 (7-17 to 7-27) * luxury items

* Making the front end look fly af (maybe Phase 2 I really want to crush the look of this to make it easier to show for potential interviews idk.)

* build the user login here if I have time.

* Plug into a Travelocity api or something to render the prices for flights and hotels. ACTUALLY much rather use Hostel World if they have one
* add a cool little travel game if I have time ie Yatzee or some dice deal.
